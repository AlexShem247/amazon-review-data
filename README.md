# Adjective Classification Model

The program goes through Amazon product reviews data, analyses it and uses the rating on the review to determine whether the adjectives or adverbs used in it have a positive or negative connotation. As it goes through more reviews, its data builts up and it can more reliably use the words alone of a review to predict the rating the user gave.
